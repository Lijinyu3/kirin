# Development with Devcontainer

For developer, we encourage you to use the following technologies:

* VSCode
* Devcontainer

There are one step to start the development environment:

. Open the project in VSCode and click on the `Reopen in Container` button.

And VSCode will automatically build the development environment based on our [pre-build images](https://hub.docker.com/r/gclub/skywardai/tags).
